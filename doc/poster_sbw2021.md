## Design rules

### Do

 * Less is better
 * Prefer to show too little over too much
 * When in doubt, remove
 * When in doubt, keep it as it is
 * Use colors to liven things up
 * Show code
 * Show quality
 * Use few (default) fonts with few (32-64-128) sizes
 * Use max 8 panels
 * Leave in errors or to-be-done things for sharp eyes

### Don't

 * Do not care about being pixel perfect
 * Do not fully adapt to color blindness
 * Do not call to action
 * Do not care about name
 * Do not care about photo

### Notes

 * In the 'Convert data' section, I wanted to show the tables,
   but this causes overcrowding
 * In the 'Safety' section, I could also show the error PLINK v1.9
   gives when chromosome number is above 96
