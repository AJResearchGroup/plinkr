#' Calculate the phenotypic values for a trait that is epistatic.
#'
#' A phenotypic value starts at 20.0.
#' Only four non-adenines results in a phenotype of 21.0
#' @inheritParams default_params_doc
#' @note  the reason a phenotypic value starts at 20.0, instead of 0.0,
#' is due to PLINK: if phenotypic values are all only zeroes and ones
#' (and twos), PLINK will interpret these as case-control codes.
#' There is no way to force PLINK to do a quantitative trait analysis on
#' zeroes and ones.
#'
#' As a workaround, epistatic traits start from twenty.
