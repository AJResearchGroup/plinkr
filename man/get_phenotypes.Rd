\title{Get the phenotypes that are named after their genetic background}
\usage{
get_phenotypes()
}
\value{
all the phenotypes that are named after their genetic background
}
\description{
Get the phenotypes that are named after their genetic background
}
\details{
To create a trait with a phenotype:
\itemize{
\item \link{create_additive_trait}
\item \link{create_custom_trait}
\item \link{create_epistatic_trait}
\item \link{create_random_trait}
}

The functions that calculate the phenotype for a genotype:
\itemize{
\item \link{calc_additive_phenotype_values}
\item \link{calc_epistatic_phenotype_values}
\item \link{calc_random_phenotype_values}
}
}
\note{
The function has the word \code{get} in its name,
as getting the result is trivial. When getting the result is non-trivial,
the word \code{create} is used.
