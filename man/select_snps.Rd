as can be checked by \link{check_snp_selector}}

\item{base_output_filename}{the base of the filenames that are
used as output for \code{PLINK}/\code{PLINK2}}

\item{plink_options}{options to run PLINK,
as created by \link{create_plink_options}}

\item{verbose}{the verbosity of a function.
Set to \link{TRUE} for more output.
Use \link{check_verbose} to detect if this argument is valid.}

There are multiple SNP selectors:
\itemize{
\item a single SNP: see \link{create_single_snp_selector}
\item a SNP range: see \link{create_snp_range_selector}
\item a window around a SNP: see \link{create_snp_window_selector}
