\title{Create testing parameters for the \link{assoc_qt} function}
\usage{
create_test_assoc_qt_params(
  maf = get_lowest_maf(),
  confidence_interval = NA,
  allow_no_sex = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{maf}{minor allele frequency threshold.
Alleles that have a frequency lower than the MAF
are excluded from the \code{PLINK} analysis.
\code{maf} must be a value between zero and 0.5
(i.e. excluding zero and excluding 0.5).
By default, \code{maf} is set to the lowest
representable non-zero floating-point value,
as obtained by \link{get_lowest_maf}

The parameter name \code{maf} is named after the
\code{PLINK} \code{--maf} flag. This was chosen over
more specific names such as \code{min_allele_frequency}).}

\item{confidence_interval}{confidence interval, a value between (and
excluding both) 0.0 and 1.0. The confidence interval helps assess
the certainty of an estimation: you can be 99 percent sure
a value is within the range of the 0.99 confidence interval

The \code{confidence_interval} is only used by \code{PLINK2}.
For \code{PLINK}, its value is ignored}

\item{allow_no_sex}{set this to \link{TRUE}
to retain phenotype values for missing-sex samples.
This parameter is named after the \code{PLINK} \code{--allow-no-sex} flag}
}
\description{
Create parameters (as created by \link{create_assoc_qt_params})
to detect associations with quantitative traits
(using \link{assoc_qt}) used for testing.
