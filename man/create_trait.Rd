\title{Create a trait with a clear genetic architecture and a known
minor allele frequency.}
\usage{
create_trait(phenotype, maf = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype}{one phenotype, named after its genetic background:
\itemize{
\item \code{random} the phenotype is a random value,
i.e. there is no association between the genetics and
this phenotype
\item \code{additive} the phenotype is perfectly additive
(the nucleotides used are A and T as these are in the word 'additive'):
\itemize{
\item \code{AA} 11.0
\item \code{AT} 10.5
\item \code{TT} 10.0
}
}}

\item{maf}{minor allele frequency threshold.
Alleles that have a frequency lower than the MAF
are excluded from the PLINK analysis.
\code{maf} must be a value between zero and 0.5
(i.e. excluding zero and excluding 0.5).
By default, \code{maf} is set to the lowest
representable non-zero floating-point value,
as obtained by \link{get_lowest_maf}

The parameter name \code{maf} is named after the
PLINK \code{--maf} flag. This was chosen over
more specific names such as \code{min_allele_frequency}).}
